I'm a minimialist, [avid reader](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/chiffonng), language learner, 
and plant-based cook. I love organzing events, from hackathons to friend hangouts, 
particularly potlucks and board game nights.

I love teaching, learning, and deliberating. I can dabble across topics of
*justice* (social, environmental, algorithmic, [epistemic justice](/tags/epistemic-justice)), 
political philosophy, and linguistics. I donate and volunteer within my means.
