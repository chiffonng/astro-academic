I am interested in researching **humanâ€“AI systems** that **reshape how people access, trust, and collaborate 
around _knowledge_**.

- Inclusivity: building systems that adapt across languages, cultures, and modalities.
- Safety: caliberating reliability and trust through AI Alignment, 
knowledge editing and unlearning, and memory mechanisms
- Collaboration: Human-AI bidrectional alignment, 
collaborative reasoning and error correction

Knowledge can be broadly defined, and so I care about many ways of
accessing and producing knowledge. In the long term, I envision a **personalized, external 
knowledge system that co-evolve with humans and society** as we forget, re-prioritize, and integrate 
new knowlege over time

I graduated in May 2025 from [Minerva University](https://minerva.edu/) studying Machine Learning &
Statistics, while living and engaging civically in 6 cities ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª as part of its global
rotation program.
