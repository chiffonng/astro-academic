I research and develop interdisciplinary approaches to make **human knowledge work and learning more inclusive, collaborative, and trustworthy** through **human-AI systems**:

- Diversity & Inclusivity: Low-resource, multilingual, and multicultural adaptation, 
and enriched AI interfaces beyond turn-based chatbot
- Human-AI Collaboration: Human-AI teaming, co-creation and attribution frameworks
- Safety: Human-AI bi-alignment (including AI Alignment), knowledge editing and unlearning,
interpretable knowledge reasoning mechanisms

Knowledge can be broadly defined, and so I care about many ways of
accessing and producing knowledge. In the long term, I envision a personalized, self-evolving
knowledge system externalized from human brain, but collaborate and augment human knowledge
and reasoning capabilities. 

I graduated in May 2025 from [Minerva University](https://minerva.edu/) studying Machine Learning &
Statistics, while living and engaging civically in 6 cities ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª as part of its global
