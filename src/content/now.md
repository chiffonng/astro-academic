I'm actively applying for New Grad jobs in data science and AI engineering, and research labs in HCI
and NLP.

I've also been volunteering to contribute to these open-source / open-science projects:

- Using AI for personal coaching and therapy for Chinese userbase
- [Language Identification for Web Data](https://wmdqs.org/shared-task/): Detect and highlight
  Vietnamese text on 150 website samples
- [SEACrowd-VL](https://seacrowd.github.io/): Participated in data labeling, generation, and quality
  control in Vietnamese to improve AI representation (Vision-Language Modeling) for Southeast Asian
  languages and culture
